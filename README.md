# Alfred-Snippet-open-files
Alfred workflow for snippet trigger open files/folders and drop &amp; drop attach files anywhere

It works pretty well on my side, and I believe it'll be pretty helpful for people who stays on the keyboard.

All you need to do with this workflow after installation is to type "\\o" anywhere in the mac, not necessarily a textfield. And then it pops up a search bar for you to search files/folders, you can choose to open files/folders or drag and drop them onto your current work or to preview in Alfred with "alt" held before any actions.

Good luck!
